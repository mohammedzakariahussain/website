            1.1 describing the purpose of it in modern business
        </p>
        <p style="padding: 15px 0px">

            it in modern business is now an integral part in business daily operations and its plays an important part in its success. it in a business can help with the overall productivity and performance of the staff, allowing them to complete tasks faster using software that provides better communication or organisation. it allows daily operations to become more efficient than it would have been without the use of it, for example with the use of inventory management software, enterprise resource planning software and customer management software
            it also plays a big part in customer services in a modern business, with customers being able to contact the business outside of business hours in their own convenience. the business also gets to improve customer engagement and implement specific marketing strategies towards their customer demographic.

            1.2 describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? what tools? what skills?
        </p>
        <p style="padding: 10px 0px 15px">
            when it comes to completing a digital project successfully the user should take a look at the skills needed for the project, for example there may be project that require coding, and it will require the user to equip themselves with those skills relevant to the area of the digital project they may be working on. python and html are commonly used coding languages used for  web applications and languages like c# and javascript are commonly used languages for software development and game development.
            as well as equipping yourself with the necessary skills to complete the digital project , project management skills are also a necessity for having a successful project, these include assigning and scheduling project tasks to team members, having meetings to discuss project deliverable and also managing time and expenses.
        </p>
        <p style="padding: 15px 0px 5px">
            1.3 plan and carry out tasks using it – e.g. making your website. how will you plan it? include a link to your trello board.
        </p>
        <p style="padding: 5px 0px 15px"> 
            in planning for the website project, it requires having to take a look at the project deliverable and them breaking it down into achievable tasks, the initial scope of the project has to be looked at and time would have to organised so tasks can be completed in time for project to meet the deadline. trello will be used to track these tasks and will help keep track of important tasks and organizing them according to the kanban principles.

            1.4 describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?
        </p>
        <p style="padding: 5px 0px 15px">   
            risks for a digital project that may cause it to fail may include such things as project management and not being able to complete tasks efficiently and in the time required, this may lead to a domino effect in small teams as some tasks may effect others. other risks include not having the required skills to complete a project, for example lack of knowledge in a program or coding language, as this will require the individuals to allot time to grasp these programs or learn a coding language, this may lead to inefficiency and errors.

            1.5 describe how you would go about selecting and using it systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?
        </p>
        <p style="padding: 5px 0px">   
            to select the right it systems and software for a digital project, you will first have to assess what is required for the project. if it is a game development project then you will need the use of more powerful hardware with capable graphics cards needed to run the project and complete tasks, you will also need the access of game development software and engine like unity. For web development software you may be looking at less powerful hardware without the need of a powerful graphics card, you could be using software like visual studio and graphics design software such as photoshop and illustrator.

        <p style="padding: 5px 0px 15px">   
            trello has helped me create tasks that set reminders when completing the website. it allows me to add tasks to the to do lists and label them according to importance. it allows me to split the project into smalls task, thus boosting productivity and not making the project feel too overwhelming as i can focus on only small parts of the project at one time.

            2.1 review the ongoing use of it tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? e.g. visual studio code, trello 

        </p>
        <p style="padding: 10px 0px 15px">
            visual studio and trello were great tools for creating and planning the website. as trello allowed me to create new tabs of new ideas that i can implent into the website in a later time, this allowed me to keep track of any idea sparks that i may have during development. it also allowed for me to the effectively plan accordingly.</p>
        <p>    
            visual studio was a great tool for the creation of the website as it allowed me to use css and html in the same software, allowing me to easily modify both, switching back and forth. there are also an abundance of resources for visual studio online so a lot of queries that arises due to lack of experience, were found easily with a search engine. 
            for some of the other more complex ideas i had regarding the creation of the website, required different coding languages like java script as it was not possible to do in html or css alone, this was a drawback as those ideas had to scrapped. 
            overall i was happy with the tools in use to create the website and for the most part they were very effective.

        <p style="padding: 15px 0px 10px">
            2.2 describe whether the it tools selected were appropriate e.g. visual studio code, trello 

        </p>
        <p style="padding: 10px 0px 15px">
            yes the it tools of trello and visual studio code were appropriate for the project as visual studio code was intuitive and easy to use. i felt the coding languages of html and css were very accessible and easy to understand. this allowed me to create a simple website without many hiccups. only limitations i came across is when trying to do more complex things with animation, also the alignment was hit or miss trying to get it where i wanted certain things to be on the page.</p>
        <p>    
            trello was also good for the project, but i think may have been more effectively if used in a group setting rather than a solo team. however the tools on trello did help me manage the project well and allow me to set reminders on tasks that needed to be completed.

        <p style="padding: 15px 0px 10px">
            2.3 assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? why? why not? you should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. what would you change? 

        </p>
        <p style="padding: 10px 0px 15px">
            the strengths of the website include that the navigation is easy to use and easily accessible, the links on the page also highlight letting the user know that the links can be clicked on. the website does not have any images that need loading so the loading speeds of the website should be good for users with slower internet download speeds. there also were no errors in the page and all pages worked as intended. </p>
        <p>    
            one of the weakness of my website include the audio snippet that was added at the welcome page that is set to auto play, however this will be missed by some browsers that have auto play audio disabled as a default. the browsers which do not seem to support this that i have tested seem to be chrome and safari, but it seems to be working fine on internet explorer. another weakness may be the minimalist look, which although it was a design decision, it may feel boring to some users.
            another weakness is when the user navigates back to the home page from the other pages in the website, the "welcome" animation starts over, which can be bothersome for users. 
        </p>
        <p>    
            the things i would change and implement is a typewriter effect for some of the headings, which i had tried to implement but struggled in doing so. 
            i would have also liked to add a scrolling feature to the paragraph text so its content displays in the centre and fades out when scrolling down, whilst the newer content fades in. 
            i think i should have researched some of the more complex ideas for before trying o implement them into the site and failing, as this would have saved me a lot of time and i could of used to focus on other executable ideas.
            also if  on hind sight i think i would not have implemented the audio element of the website, as it does not execute on most browsers and took up too much time from the project. 
            overall i am happy with the website, with only a few issues that i would have liked to change.

            2.4 describe further improvements you can make to your project 

        </p>
        <p style="padding: 10px 0px 15px">
            further improvements could include testing the website for mobile allowing it to be implemented for smaller screens without issues.
            i would have also liked to implement more animations in the front page with some shooting stars effect in the background, just to make the website more interesting. i would have also liked to add further text effects in addition to the fade in used.
            i also could add more greetings in the home page in different languages e.g. "hello" in different languages fading in and out of the screen.
            a contact menu could have been a good improvement to the website, by having the contact link open up a email software like gmail.

            2.5 review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose

        </p>
        <p style="padding: 10px 0px 15px">
            in preparing the appropriate content for the website, i had to first design and create ideas on how the website will look. i then prepared the content need,  these included such things as font required, paragraph content, styling, layout and colour scheme. during the idea stage i also looked into what coding will be required to create the website, for example if any animations will be used.
            when the content was added the layout and formatting was taken into consideration, this included creating navigation to become visible and usable on every page on the site. the navigation was also formatted so it is easily visible and accessible without interfering with the main content of the website. the formatting of the content of  the website was centered to avoid any overlap with the navigation and to keep the users eyes focused in the content instead of being distracted.
          
            to get error free pages i had to test the website making sure they're are no dead ends and all pages work as intended. i also tested the website on different browsers to check if the formatting is working as designed. this testing also allowed me to see what things do not work on different browsers.

            3.1 review the benefits and drawbacks of it tools and systems used in terms of  productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? how? could you have done it in teams? 

        </p>
        <p style="padding: 10px 0px 15px">
            the it tools used in the project included trello and visual studio code, in terms of efficiency i could have been more efficient by completing the initial more manageable ideas of the website first, for example font, layout and navigation, i then could have focused on the more complex ideas to implement. </p>
        <p> the strengths of the it tools used are that they allowed the project to be planned effectively and didn't have much drawbacks to the planning and efficiency. the only real issues that i have come across that may have effected productivity is how some of the items on the website did not work properly on some browsers, and when you are testing on one browser, it can create confusion and having to spend too much time on trying to fix the code and to make it work, even though the browser does not support it, e.g. the auto play audio is not enabled in chrome, but works in internet explorer.
            if the project was created in a team, it would have been more productive and efficient. this is because we could allocate roles to certain team member, for example having one person manage the planning and trello and updating the board. we can also have different members of the team working on different webpages, working off an initial layout design.

            3.2 describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency 
        </p>
        <p style="padding: 10px 0px 15px">
            to improve productivity and efficiency of the project will require usinfg trello more efficiently, this includes adding smaller more bite sized tasks, which will help the project become more manageable. also creating a method that shows the importance of a tasks by highlighting each tasks with a corresponding colour, this allows you to easily identify the most important tasks and use time more efficiently to complete them.  </p>

        <p style="padding: 15px 0px 10px">
            3.3 develop solutions to improve own productivity using it in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? team work? use of slack? 

        </p>
        <p style="padding: 10px 0px 15px">
            to improve my own productivity in the project using it in future digital projects include the use of github, as this will allow to share code in team scenario faster and more effectively. this will allow the other team member to view the most up to date project and see any changes made. team working would help future projects to become more productive and efficient by having team members with specific roles that they can take, allowing individuals to solely focus on one task within the project.  </p>
        <p>    
            zoom calls would also become a benefit with the use of stand ups and team meetings outlining tasks and goals that need to achieved. sharing the screen in zoom will also benefit the productivity of a project as it will allow the other team members to help if there is something that needs to fixed. 
            slack can also become a it tool that would benefit the productivity of the project, by allowing team members to communicate with each other more efficiently, adding files and code to a group. slack would be also good for contacting specific group members and working with them on specific tasks.

        <p style="padding: 15px 0px 10px">
            3.4 describe how you would go about testing digital solutions

        </p>
        <p style="padding: 10px 0px 15px">
            testing digital solutions requires the website to be tested on multiple browsers to check if all functions work correctly on them and which elements do not work as intended. also a good idea would be to make the website more efficient for smaller screens and mobile devices. cross browser testing will have to be done on mobiles too, to identify any issues that can be identified and fixed  </p>
        <p>    
            usability testing is also required, which requires the website to be testted to see if the user is able to use the website as intended and if all the elements such as navigation is easily accessible to them. you will also need to check if the user can read and see all the content of the website and adjust according to the feedback received. accessibility issues will also need to be implemented and tested allowing for users with disabilities to access and use the website without any issues.
